This is the first post to my blog, so in true programmer spirit, `Hello World`.

As time progresses, I hope to fill this blog with projects that I work on, and thoughts I have about topics that interest me.  These topics typically revolve around Automation and IoT (specifically Smart Home).  

Also, this blog was made possible with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a wonderful open source project, and it is hosted with Github pages.
