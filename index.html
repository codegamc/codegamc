									<h2>Things I Can Do</h2>
									<h3>
										Programming
									</h3>
									<h5> Android App Development</h5>
                                    <!-- update once apps are done and leave job-->
									<p>

										I have experience working with Android App development, independantly taking projects from conceptualization to 
										completion based on criteria set by others.  This experince includes many aspects of the android API, including communicating with phsyiological sensors over custom BlueTooth protocols requiring realtime decoding and parsing of bytestreams, and utilizing onboard android sensors and GPS for data gathering. 

                                        Apps in development make use of sensors and mathmatical models to display relevant information to the user.

									</p>

									<h5> Matlab </h5>
									<p>
										I have experience writing functional scripts in MATLAB's scripting language. This code was designed to manipulate,
                                         plot and model extremely large amounts of physiological data. 
									</p>
										<h5> Programming Language Skills </h5>
									<p>
									  
										My classes at CWRU were taught in Java, giving me both a good conceptual and applied knowledge of the language. Working heavily with android development, my Java skills only got stronger.
                                       
                                        I have also used python for personal projects due to its speed of development, however I have a more applied understanding than conceptual. My python skills is, as with everything, a work in progress, and I would love an opportunity to learn more.

                                    <p>
                                        I'm capable of working and developing in OS X, Windows, and Linux.
                                        I use my Mac on a daily basis, but while at work, used 
                                        Windows.  I occasionally play around with Linux to maintain competancy, 
                                        and use it in projects for fun.  In OS X and Linux, I'm capable of working
                                        with the Bash Shell.
